Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number.

You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor.
You can use the mod operator (%) in most languages to check for a remainder
For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because: 7 % 2 = 1

on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.
